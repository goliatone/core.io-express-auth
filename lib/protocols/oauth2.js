/*
 * OAuth 2.0 Authentication Protocol
 *
 * OAuth 2.0 is the successor to OAuth 1.0, and is designed to overcome
 * perceived shortcomings in the earlier version. The authentication flow is
 * essentially the same. The user is first redirected to the service provider
 * to authorize access. After authorization has been granted, the user is
 * redirected back to the application with a code that can be exchanged for an
 * access token. The application requesting access, known as a client, is iden-
 * tified by an ID and secret.
